============================================

You will be in charge to develop a rest web API that allow to manage a
drug catalog for external drugs providers.


<span style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Backend service REST API</span> 
------------------------

You must provide a backend service to manage drugs (create, read, update
and delete drugs). This information should be persisted.

A drug has the following properties:

-   Code : String, max length : 30 characters

-   Label : String, max length : 100 characters

-   Description : String

-   Price : Decimal, price lower than or equal 0 isnâ€™t allowed

It should be possible to get a list of drugs filtering it optionally by
code or label. To prevent unauthorized access, the API should be
protected (e.g. API key).

<b>Sum up </b>
======

You must use .net core c\# for the backend service to implement.

Please provide us a link to the git repos for your app or send by mail
the project group.

Don't spend more than 4 hours on this task.
